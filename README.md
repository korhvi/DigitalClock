# Digital Clock Application

# Digital Clock

This is a simple digital clock application built using Python and PyQt5. The application displays the current time with a customizable interface that includes day/night mode switching and adjustable window opacity.

## Features

- **Day/Night Mode**: Switch between day mode (bright colors) and night mode (darker, muted colors) with a single button click.
- **Adjustable Window Opacity**: Use the built-in slider to adjust the transparency of the application window, allowing you to see through the clock to what's happening behind it.
- **Real-Time Clock**: The application displays the current time, updated every second.
